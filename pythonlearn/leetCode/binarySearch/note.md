1. always compare nums[i] <> target, put nums[i] at first in comparison
2. comparison in the loop
        [mid] > target, right = mid
        [mid] < target, left = mid
   if first position
        [mid] = target, right = mid
        [left] = target, return left
        [right] = target, return right
   if last position
        [mid] = target, left = mid
        [right] = target, return right
        [left] = target, return left
        
3. 2d matrix, do not think about x, y, and coordinate, think i in row, j in column
    n600 smallest rectangel
4.
